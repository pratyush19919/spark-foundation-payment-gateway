Hello, I have created a website and integrated razorpay payment gateway through which one can donate money.This is task-4 for web development internship by Saprk-Foundation.
Flask and HTML along with bootstrap are used to create and run the server.I used the MySQL and FLASK-SQLAlchemy to store and organize the user data.
Also at a successful transaction an email is sent to the donor regarding the details of the transaction. To pay the money Razorpay API was in the website.
For hosting the website i used pythonanywhere free webhosting cloud. The main app which runs flask is flask_app.py and all the HTML files are in templates folder.
